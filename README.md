# DevOps/SRE aphorisms

### Kind of engineering-specific

* Allspaw’s Law: TTR is more important than TBF (for most types of F). [[ref]](https://www.kitchensoap.com/2010/11/07/mttr-mtbf-for-most-types-of-f)
* The No Asshole Law: It’s better to avoid a toxic employee than hire a superstar. [[ref]](https://hbr.org/2015/12/its-better-to-avoid-a-toxic-employee-than-hire-a-superstar)
* The No Free Lunch Rule: For every complex problem, there is an solution that is clear, simple, and wrong.
* The Other Markov Property: The reliability of a system cannot exceed the product of the reliabilities of its dependencies.
* McKinley’s Razor: With all things being equal, the most boring technology tends to be the right one. [[ref]](http://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology)

### General (but still very appropriate)

* The perfect is the enemy of the good enough. [Voltaire]
* Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away. [Antoine de Saint-Exupery]
